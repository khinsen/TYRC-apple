I published my very first (non-scientific) article in a French Magazine named
"Tremplin Micro" in 1988, 32 years ago. It was a program written in Applesoft
Basic that zoomed out a 21x21 pixels area of an image by a factor 4 (not very
impressive by 2020 standards). As written in the original "cover" letter I
sent, the zoom was also very slow. At that time, I was learning 6502 assembler
but I was not proficient enough to write the program using it. Thirty-two years
might appear a relatively small lapse of time compared to Human history, but
for digital computer history, this is actually huge, almost half of its
history. Imagine that the Apple //e was using a 6502 microprocessor with a
8-bits data bus, had 64Ko of RAM and the speed was barely 1Mhz. The text modes
were 40 or 80 columns, and the video modes include a standard graphic mode
(140x96 pixels, 16 colors) or an impressive high-resolution mode (280x192
pixels, 6 colors). Despite these apparent limitations, the Apple //e has been a
very popular machine complemented by an extended software library. For the Ten
Years Reproducibility Challenge, I thus decided to try to re-run the original
program, just for the sake of checking if I could. This includes finding the
sources (in a usable form), remembering how to load and start a program in
Applesoft, producing some original data (image) to test the program, and of
course, checking if it was running as expected.

To run the program, you will need an apple //e emulator (for example [Virtual
II](http://www.virtualii.com/), [MAME](https://www.mamedev.org/) or [Apple
//jse]( https://www.scullinsteel.com/apple/e)), load the
[challenge.dsk](challenge.dsk) and boot it. Then follow instruxtion
